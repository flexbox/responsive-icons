### Quickly copy paste icons

A design pattern with html unicode symbols usefull in webdesign. The advantages of using html entities rather than images :

1. It loads fast because it is text base.
2. Scalable according to font size.
3. Easy to change color and sizing.

## How it works ?

I use the css pseudo-element `:before` and `:after` for include icons. If you want to use the class sytem simply add the file `symbol.css` in your project.
