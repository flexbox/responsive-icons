### Quickly copy paste icons

Webapp with html unicode symbols usefull in webdesign. The advantages of using html entities rather than images :

1. It loads fast because it is text base.
2. Scalable according to font size.
3. Easy to change color and sizing.
4. No dependency with webfont

## How it works ?

I use the css pseudo-element `:after` to include icons.
